\section{Zielsetzung}
\label{sec:aims}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

		Es soll eine ... entworfen und umgesetzt werden.
		Der vorgesehene Anwendungsfall ist


		Cloud-Umgebung für virtuelle Maschinen
		herausragende Merkmale studieren und vor allem erleben

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		
		Audacticty
		Coursera

		Kein Wissen über User
		keine Live-Experimente wie Instantlab

		Aber: Aufgabenabgabesystem

\section{Technologien}
\label{sec:technologies}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

		Allgemeines zur Plattform und zur Virtualisierung

		Plattform Intel x86 / Microsoft wegen der durchgängigen Unterstützung. \cite{PopekGoldberg}

		Spezialfälle: Binary rewriting, manche Operationen schneller in Softwre als in Hardware

		Warum ist Intel problematisch??

		Typ 1/2 Virtualisierung (hier ggf. nicht relevant)

		\subsection{VMWare}
		%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

		Relevanz: Feld eröffnet, große Menge Hardware

		%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		\subsection{KVM}
		%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

		Relevanz: Standard reportoire, Open Source
