\section{Aufgabenstellung}
\label{sec:aims}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%




		Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit sollen sechs verschiedene Betriebssysteme angewendet werden, zu denen die Durchführung von jeweils zwei Experimenten geplant ist. Begonnen wird dabei mit der Betrachtung von... Abschließend wird ... . Ziel ist es die historischen Betriebssysteme den Studenten originalgetreu zur Verfügung zu stellen. 
		Es soll eine ... entworfen und umgesetzt werden.
		Der vorgesehene Anwendungsfall ist


		Cloud-Umgebung für virtuelle Maschinen
		herausragende Merkmale studieren und vor allem erleben

\label{sec:technologies}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

		Allgemeines zur Plattform und zur Virtualisierung

		Plattform Intel x86 / Microsoft wegen der durchgängigen Unterstützung. \cite{PopekGoldberg}

		Spezialfälle: Binary rewriting, manche Operationen schneller in Softwre als in Hardware

		Warum ist Intel problematisch??

		Typ 1/2 Virtualisierung (hier ggf. nicht relevant)
